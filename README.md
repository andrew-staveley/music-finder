This is a project for Flatiron by Andrew Staveley

Powered by Apple Music API
https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/Searching.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017632-CH5-SW1

The basic requirements of the project are:

-Use fetch to recieve data from an API, the data must return with:
    At least 5 objects
    Each object with at least 3 attributes

-Use 3 different event listeners

How the project works:

This project works by essentially allowing a user to search for a song and then returning results from Apple Music's catalog. It includes links to the song, artist, album, as well as shows some other useful information.

STILL IN PROGRESS: NEED TO ADD;

2 More event liseners
? Maybe add  a favoriting section.
